"Dear Principal,

I think you should use Policy 1 and allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. It would give students a way to communicate to each other, but also allow them to focus on their work during class. If any student is caught using their phones during class, you can take their phone away as a warning. It also gives students a way to communicate with their parents if anything goes wrong at school. For example if a student forgot something at home and they need their parent to drop it off at their school, they could use their cell phones to contact them. Or, if a student isn't feeling well and they need to go home, they can contact their parent to bring them home, with permission from the health teacher or other school staff.

I think that giving students a chance to use their phones during lunch period and free times will make them more eager to come to school. Allowing cellular usage will help them to see that you can trust that they will follow the school rules. And making sure they turn their phones off during class to make sure their focused in class is an excellent idea. It gives students the freedom they want, and the chance to communicate with friends and family. Whether its for emergency or recreational purposes, they will be satisfied and grateful for the privilege to use their phones at school. I also think that allowing them to use their phones will help them to get their mind off of school work and help them to relax for a little bit. And when they return to class, their minds will be refreshed and ready to learn something new.

Students will be happy to know that they won't be restricted to use their phones during free time and lunch, and a majority of them will probably want to keep using their phones at school, so its a definite possibility that they will follow the rules. They also want you to see that you an trust them, and they will follow your rules.",0,1
"Do you think summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed? In my opinion, summer project should be student-designed. For students, summer is a break from school; students should have the freedom to do a project based on what they want. Reasons why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility.

First reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative. If students come up with what their projects is based on, it shows their creativeness. They can describe and show their personality through their project. They can also show their character and more about who they are. This can be a opportunity for students to open up with their teacher and classmates. Students can come out their comfort zone and be unique when creating their project.

Second reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because students feel less pressured. If students have a certain project, they feel more pressured to do exactly what the project is based on. The project may be based on a subject they may not feel comfortable with. If students have a student-designed project, they will avoid that conflict because they will be able to choose their own topic. This may also pressure students because they could get a project that doesn't appeal to their personality.

Third reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students responsibility. Students will have all summer to create their project; if the project is not done, it shows they aren't responsible. The project shows if they can be able to do a project before the new school year begins. Certain students will prove they're able to complete a project throughout the summer. While others will prove they aren't responsible enough to complete a project. In addition, this will give them a task to do while they aren't in school.

In conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be student-based. My reasons on why I believe this should be a student-designed project is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility. A summer project should be a project you are comfortable with and can show how you unique every individual is. The project will also keep students feeling educated while not being in school.",0,1
"Limiting the usage of cars has a varirty of advantages. From having a less expensive life, to less air pollution, and overall a generally happier life. Thinking about all the excess and stress that comes with owning a car is tiring. Not to mention the hazardous effect it had on our lives. Would it not be nice to just take off some of that burden off of you, and be a happier person?.Let me help you out on how to achieve that.

Owning a car is pricey! In Freiburg along with paying for your house you also have to pay for a parking garage, which comes with a hefty price. Did i not mention the distance you have to walk to park? lets just say you might as well have taken the bus.""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park",0,1
"Are driverless cars a good idea? Are these cars a postive invention for our world today? Driverless cars can help our lives in so many aspects and make our world better. The development of these cars will bring more safety to drivers, prevent accidents, and also use less fuel.

Driverless cars will make driving safer for the driver. The cars will help the driver to avoid texting while driving. The manufacturers will lessen the texting while driving issues by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays, helping the driver pay more attention to the road and things happening around them. The driver will be more aware of what is happening on the roads, rather than paying attention to cell phones.

The development of these cars will also prevent accidents. Google's Toyota Prius, for example, uses a spinning sensor on the roof. The sensor uses laser beams to make a constantly updating 3-D model of everything around the car. This can help the driver be aware of things surrounding their automobile, such as other cars, animals, or pedestrians. With the help of this sensor, drivers will see more things surrounding them, preventing accidents. Google's cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash.

Lastly the driverless cars will consume less fuel. This will reduce prices for drivers and make a more eco-friendly enviornment. The world is often trying to come up with solutions to use less fuels. The development of this vehicle would take a step in helping the eco-friendliness of our world.

Using driverless cars will be a postive improvement to our world. The cars will make the roads more safe for drivers, help prevent accidents, and conserve fuel. In conclusion, the development of driverless cars are a great advancement to our world and help our day-to-day lives.",0,1
"Dear Mr. Principal,

I have heard of your potential decision to require community service from all students. (I am assuming that the students we are referring to are older than elementary school age.)

The details of the requirement have not yet been released to us yet, but if the time you require is more than six hours a week, I oppose the decision to make it an obligation. I do not think that students should be made to do this. The choice to perform a service for the community is definitely one that should be encouraged, but should remain a choice. The reason I think this is because many students have other responsibilities they must use the time to do. If you require them to do community service, their other responsibilities will have to be put on hold until they can get back to them. Some of their activities that they need the time to do may be personal, for example, visiting a sick relative. Others are for their education, like going to an internship (for high school aged students). Either way, this decision will affect how your students will have to manage their schedules after school hours.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0,1
"Driverless Cars are a major form of transportation that will hopefully arrive in the near future. These cars will be able to drive on their own on the roadways. So far, there are cars that are semi-autonomous, where the driver still needs to retain some control. Driverless cars will have a better impact on drivers in the future, such as an increase in advanced technology, an increase in safety, and the ability to assist drivers.

One major aspect of the driverless cars would be the increased advanced technology. This technology will be able to mimic a human driver. Sensors will play a big role in this, and Google's Toyota Prius includes sensors on the left rear wheel, on the roof, radar sensors, an inertial motion sensor, a video camera on the rearview mirror, and a GPS receiver. Also, a spinning sensor on the roof of the car allows laser beams to create a 3-D model of the car's surroundings, which will enable the car to have more control.

Another benefit of driverless cars would be the improvement in safety. Sensors will become more advanced and will be able to detect and avoid dangerous situations. The information from the sensors can allow the car to apply brakes to individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine. This will provide more control over the car and can even have a better response than a human can. As technology increases and becomes more advanced, sensors and computer software and hardware will provide more safety to drivers and passengers and also allow cars to handle tougher situations on their own.

Along with the improved technology of driverless cars, these cars will be able to assist drivers on the roadways. Drivers don't have to completely go hands-off while driving, but the car can make driving easier and safer. So far, none of the developed cars is completely driverless, but they can perform most of the basic roadway tasks. Humans only need to take over in dangerous situations, such as an accident or while driving through work zones. The cars will be able to get the driver's attention when a problem arises, so that the driver doesn't necessarily have to pay attention to the road the whole time. They will only have to pay attention during certain situations that the car cannot handle.

Driverless cars have not fully been developed yet, but manufacturers have been working to create fully-functioning driverless cars, and will hopefully be on the roadways sometime in the near future. There are many more benefits of these cars than there are limitations, and they will make driving much easier and safer for drivers and passengers in the future.",0,1
"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves tells the story of how joining a program called The Seagoing Cowboys can change your life forever. As someone who has gone to different countries, I know first hand how traveling can expand your mind beyond measure. That is why, if given the opportunity to go back and choose again, I would choose to take part in the Seagoing Cowboys program. In fact, I am so convinced that joining the Seagoing Cowboys is worth it that I will provide three reasons that you should join as well.

The first reason that I think joining the Seagoing Cowboys is worth your time is due to all the opportunities that you will receive as a part of the program. When Luke became a part of the Seagoing Cowboys, he was immediately thrown into situations that he wouldn't normally face back at home. As the article states, he was delivering animals to war-torn Europe. He traveled the oceans and visited countries in Asia. The article also mentions that over two years, Luke completed nine trips, more than any other seagoing cowboy."" These opportunities that Luke had, to visit other countries and help in the process, are opportunities that can change your life forever.

The second reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because of all the memories and experiences that you will make along the way. According to the piece that I read earlier this week, during his time on ships Luke was also able to enjoy leisure activities while sailing the sea. He mentions in the article that he enjoyed diving from high platforms while on deck, and even enjoy[ed] movies shown by the crew. These are experiences that are worth the time and effort to join. It is important to remember that life is made up of many experiences and memories. By traveling and helping others, we have the opportunity to make memories that can last a lifetime.

The last reason that I want to mention for why you should join the Se agoing Cowboys program is that doing so can expand your worldview, helping you to understand others and yourself better. According to the article, when Luke traveled the oceans and visited countries in Asia, he saw and experienced many things he never thought possible; This unique experience significantly broadened his worldview, and it can do the same for everyone else too. Traveling is one of the best ways to learn more about yourself and others. It is a way of experiencing other ways of being, living and understanding things in the world.

In conclusion, The Seagoing Cowboys was a great program that changed the lives forever to those who were involved, and it can change yours too. The program provides opportunities that can lead us to experiences of a lifetime. It can also give us memories that will stay with us always. Finally, it can help open doors that expand our horizons and our understanding of others. These reasons are more than enough for me to recommend that you take advantage of The Seagoing Cowboys program when the opportunity is given. So if you are looking for a new opportunity to learn and have new experiences, look into being apart of The Seagoing Cowboys today.",1,0
"Students want to enjoy their summer break, but when summer projects are assigned, it is hard to do so. Which is why students should be in charge of designing their own summer projects. This will help students develop responsibility as well as keep their minds refreshed on educaton and open doors for different careers.

Firstly, responsibility is a beneficial trait that test one's ability to complete tasks. Giving pupils the ability to create and do projects on their own will strengthen the skill of responsibility. It will help the students further apprciate being able to design their own summer projects.

Secondly, having students in charge of creating projects for themselves keeps their minds refreshed on education. Students tend to forget what they learned from their previous school year during the summer. Allowing students to stay busy during the summer will further prepare them for the upcoming school year.

Thirdly, letting students be in charge of their own proects will more than likely open doors for their future. If some students desire to persue a career in education, they can develop the skills for that career through having control of their own summer projects. They can learn how to assign projects to their future students.

However, many may say that allowing students to be in charge of their summer projects is a bad idea. They infer that the teacher should be in charge of creating the projects due to the experience teachers have over ther students. In contrast, allowing students to create their own projects over teachers alow the students to challenge their brains, therefore, developing their education.

In summary, developing responsibility, opening career paths and keeping an open mind on education are valid reasons for allowing students to design their own summer projects over teachers. Teachers should allow students to be independent and let them be in control of their education. This will lead to a more advanced and updated education for school systems in the future.",0,1
"To the principal:

I do not agree with the proposed change to the policy affecting the minimum grade of student/athletes. Assuming that you have that power, I believe that changing the minimum GPA would not improve the grades of those people that you would have labeled ineligible to play sports for the school. If they are forced out of sports, they may turn to other activities that interest them to replace playing sports for our school, and the new activity is unlikely to be studying or doing homework. While I am a student/athlete, I am a straight-A student, so it is unlikely that I would be directly affected by this change in the rules. Many of the people who would be affected by the change would not be positively influenced by being kicked off their sports team. Some people simply can't or won't be a B average student, because of many factors weighing on them, besides the sport they play. If the rules were changed, then our athletics teams would lose many good players, which would give rival schools a clear advantage over ours in regards to the size and quality of sports teams. If i were to be kicked out of a sports team, the first thing I would do is go and sign up for a non-school-sponsored league and play in it, and I think a lot of my peers would be likely to do the same if they were put in that situation. If some people just aren't able to excel in school, but do excel in sports, changing the minimum average would be a sort of discrimination. I understand that someone's grades may be more important to you than sports, but every student is different, and some may be content to simply graduate as an average student from this school and move on to the next level in their athletics career, and you shouldn't take advantage of your power by changing their eligibility to play on an athletics team. Not everyone wishes to grow up and be an intellectually inclined person, as you are, and teaching the basics to everyone is this school's job. And choosing their own path, whether it be as a scholar or an athlete, should be their's.",0,1
"Driverless cars have been imagined and desired for years. But now we are getting good enough technology to actually realize the dream of driverless cars. The subject of driverless cars, like all things, has pros and cons. But when it comes to driving vehicles, safety should be the first concern.

The article mentions many of the new safety features of driverless cars. Some of these are the sensors that keep the car from hitting objects. Another safety feature is the GM seats that vibrate when the driver is about to back into something. There are many others as well, and these safety features prove that we are close to getting safe, and fully functioning driverless cars.

However, there are some concerns about safety in driverless cars.

Many are concerned that the cars will not be able to respond to certain circumstances, like weaving through traffic, getting through an accident, or sliding on ice. There have even been cases of automatic breaking features breaking to quickly. What this means is that sometimes, cars with automattic breaking will break to quickly for the driver behind them to respond. This causes the driver behind to rear end the car with the automattic breaks.

Personally, I don't think we should use driverless cars, due to safety risk. It is just to soon, and the technology isn't quite good enough yet. However, our technology is improving all the time, and at some point in the near future, it just might be good enough. But untill that time comes, I believe that driverless cars should not be used.",0,1
"Dear Principal,

My name is
I think that walking suspension needs to change which students could be at school and students could do extracurricular again. I cannot believe they making this decision because a lot of students is at barely C average and making them have B- average is a lot to ask because three of them have bad grades in one class but are doing well in another. I hate what they are doing to students because students not going to live up to you and students doesn't have the right counselor and I believe C average is average to reach and don't do this because their bad grades in one class isn't their regular grade. if some students took extra credit at the end of the year to stop given away their C average than that is good because most students if don't pass other classes then they won't drop at B average. This is not good because it is discrimination because high school is not bad as students get closer into grade levels, they struggle due to anxiety or teeniage banters or due to family problems. you are just giving up on them and the students around them. I think about kids who wouldn't be at they class experience and they be in more classes. Change your mind on law so next year and give students a chance to at least pass the grade with B average and not keep giving them stress and low understanding abilities because you keep making them highly pressured.",1,0
"Imagine for a minute that you are at school, on three hours of sleep with an innate ability to care for anything at this present time. You wish that you could just crawl back into your hovel and sleep for a few more hours. Despite your most earnest wishes, however, your required presence at school forbids such activities from transpiring. Luckily for you, there is yet a ray of hope. Some schools have begun to offer distance learning as a way for students to attend from home, usually via online means. I believe that students stand to gain from this alternate method of attendance. I think this because distance learning decreases stress on students, reduces bullying, and is a healthy alternative for students with social anxiety. Furthermore, distance learning provides the student with an enhanced ability to pursue self-education.

For many students, school can be the progenitor of a stressful and mentally debilitating environment. This, consequentially, leads to a decrease in a student's mental and even physical health. This negative environment is usually achieved though an overabundance of homework and classwork, as well as assorted busy-work and tight deadlines. Through that invention which is distance learning, students will have an option to choose a slower-paced working environment. When working from a computer, classwork and homework lose distinction, and just become ""work,"" as there is no assigned place to start and finish it. This alone would do wonders for the mental health of students. To use an example from my own experiences with distance learning, I have found assignments done online to be more enjoyable and less stressful than those done in a classroom.

Another factor that would considerably benefit student health is the drastic reduction in instances of bullying that distance learning would bring. For the uninitiated, bullying is when one person engages in harmful acts repeatedly and over an extended period of time against another person. Schools have only served to increase instances of bullying through zero-tolerance policies, in which the victim is punished equally as much as the aggressor. This also leads to students being afraid to report bullying, as they would also risk punishment. Distance learning would reduce bullying by putting ""distance"" between a bully and a victim of bullying. While cyberbulling would still be present, as well as an issue, it is considerably less damaging when compared to the verbal and physical confrontations that can be seen on school grounds.

Distance learning would also be considered a pious alternative of sorts for those students who do not hold social interaction in high esteem, myself included. While most students can be considered to be outgoing in one way or another, there is a large minority of students that range from being just generally introverted to having crippling social anxiety. Their needs are usually overlooked in most schools, where the social climate in many cases is best described as ""riotous."" The prospect of attending classes from home for these students would be incredibly enticing, and would be calming for them. To use another personal example, I often find myself to be more productive at home than I do at school, in part because of the disruptive social climate that classrooms have.

Perhaps the most consequential result of distance learning would be an enhancement in the student's ability to pursue self-education. Self-education is, unsurprisingly, when a student independently seeks out and digests information, whether it is needed for school or not. Self-education can also have a profound effect on students, whether by giving them a higher grade on a test, or leading them to decide on a college major based off of a topic that they find to be interesting. To use myself an example, I have been educating myself on matters of Astronomy, Military History, and Geography for approximately 7 years now. In that time, I have participated in three state-level geography competitions, the second of which ranked me as third in the state in knowledge of Ancient Geography. In Astronomy, my self-education allowed me to get full marks on almost every Astronomy-related assignment in school, and in Military History, perhaps my strongest subject, I have connected myself with various historians and am currently making inroads into publishing work of my own design in a Military Journal. With distance learning, myself and every other like-minded student would have more time to pursue these subjects.

In conclusion, it is my belief that students would benefit immensely from distance learning. Working from home would take students out of a stressful school environment, and by extension protect them from bullying. That same home environment would also be better suited for more introverted students, who might feel anxious while being in school. Distance learning would also allow students to better pursue self-education, which would have positive effects for them presently and also later in life. Overall, distance learning stands to enrich the lives of students, while also serving to better their mental and physical health.",0,1

"Dear Florida state senator, I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I argue for keeping the Electoral College because of several reasons backed up with information.

Firstly, I'd like to point out that the Electoral College makes it so that larger states don't have larger influence than smaller states. If the Electoral College is removed then larger states shall have much more political power than smaller states. Which means that a small state might not get the same amount of attention from presidential candidates as a larger state would like Florida.

Secondly, the Electoral College avoids Runoff Elections in which no Presidential candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It avoids that problem because candidates can win Presidency by electoral votes instead of popularity vote. For example, Nixon and Clinton didn't have the majority of the popular votes, but they still won because of electoral votes. If the Electoral College hadn't exist then elections might be more frustrating for everyone, because the Electoral College makes a certainty of outcome.

Thirdly, the Electoral College makes sure that a presidential candidate has transregional appeal. This is good because a candidate with only regional appeal is probably not going to be a very good president. And besides without the Electoral College there would be many presidents with regional appeal with would make other states feel left out, and this could be catastrophic to the unity of America.

In conclusion, despite the Electoral College isn't exactly of democratic origins, it still equalizes the political power of states, makes sure that candidates have transregional appeal and avoids runoff elections. Overall I say that the Electoral College is very important in keeping how we choose our president balanced and smooth.",0,1
"Phones and Driving

Many people can argue that using a phone in any capacity while driving should not be allowed. However, it can also be argued that it is useful because phones can come in handy if your car were to break down if you could use the ""hands-free"" options and when it is used as a tracking device. Many people can argue that using phones are unsafe while driving but that is not necessarily true. You need to make sure that you use your phone wisely while driving, use it correctly and for the right reasons. There are many situations where phones should be allowed when driving especially when it comes to your safety.

Firstly, a reason why using your phone while driving is that it could be useful to make calls if your car has a problem or if you are in danger. If I were to be in an unsafe situation like if my car were to break down, and I did not have my phone with me, I would not have had a way to notify someone and get help in time. I would have to ask a stranger to use their phone, which could in fact put me in more danger since I would be putting my life in someone else's hands.

There are many apps on your phone that can help you in any situation you may get into like, ""Apps like iWrecked allow you to store and access all pertinent information, send a report, and access emergency resources with great ease and efficiency""(School). There is also a crash detecting ability that comes with the app Life 360 just in case of an accident, ""Crash detection uses patented technology to detect major collisions. It relies on sensors in your phone, like your accelerometer and GPS, to detect a significant impact whenever the vehicle is moving over 25 mph""(life). A lot of apps now don't even require you to press or swipe at anything to use them while driving.

Also, with the new hands-free accessories available, there is less danger involved since you are able to be less distracted since you are paying more attention to the road. ""Researchers analyzed accident and traffic citations for college students who claimed to use hands-free phones and those who used handheld devices in general. Both types of students were equally likely to wind up in car accidents. However, study participants with hands-free devices did receive fewer speeding tickets and general traffic citations than those with ordinary cell phones""(Housely).

You can use your phone as long as it doesn't interfere with your driving. ""A hands-free mobile phone can minimize such issues, allowing drivers to make calls without ever taking their eyes off the road or their hands off the steering wheel""(Housely). Another reason why hands free is a good idea is because there is a way for people to utilise their mobiles without looking at it while driving. Not only are phones easier to use with hands-free options, but they also can help you before you even swipe it open.

If I am ever in the need to go meet someone in a place that I've never been and I do not have access to a phone, I will not have a tracking device on me in case I get lost or someone is trying to get a hold of me in case there is no service. Although the phone may not have service, the tracker will allow my family to know where I am. This tracker isn't just useful for me it is also useful for my parents to know exactly where I am. Now there are different apps and programs available on most phones that help with tracking such as Life 360 and Find My iPhone. In life 360 there is also some sort of detection, and it helps when you've been in any sort of accident. ""Life360 crash detection is an automated service that knows when you've been in an accident, either as a driver or passenger, and asks if you're ok. If help is needed or you don't respond, life 360 will notify your circle members and emergency contacts on your behalf and share your exact location,""(life). This way they will have a location on me in case something happens. If you do not bring your phone, everyone would be searching for hours. In another instance, if I would not have access to a phone while I was being followed by someone, I would not be able to call the proper authorities to get help fast. On the apple website itself, it gives you brief information and you can install it, ""Apple receives this location information only when you locate your device, turn on Lost Mode, or enable Send Last Location. Location data is only retained for 24 hours so we can display the last known location of your device. Find My iPhone also automatically turns on Activation Lock, which requires your Apple ID to be entered before anyone can erase or reactivate your device""(Apple).

In conclusion, there were examples of different situations as to why phones should be allowed while driving. In the first example I explained how a phone would be handy when there is a car emergency. I also talked about how using the phone while driving can become less distracting when there is a hands-free option. And for safety reasons, there is a way for anyone to be tracked, if you are in danger. The majority of people think that not using your phone while driving is a better idea for safety reasons. These are a few reasons why driving with a phone at any capacity would be a lot more beneficial.

"Helping someone identify their land. When you ask different people, you are getting different opinions. Let the confusion keep you company in your life. Dont wanna ask your friend why he has green hair? Well, ask your sister who has three heads. Who knows its for wedding guest but she thinks he's hiding something. Like when you're poor and have to hide the ring in a clown car, but this clown car is full of bananas and fits a small car. What do you think they talking bout now? I bet it's about makeup, people always say something is makeup if the inlaws are around. Just asking for a friend who's just not sure what that is today. Ok is all right by is not specific, so ASK AGAIN the dutch baby plus my favorite bananas! Too's a-okay. You have to ask again to not get a reaction like ""are you okay? should you go to the hospital? Those are the same things my mother would say. So just expect your friend to say same things to you, but if you ask again they will repeat it to you no problem. So, they are making sure you know exactly what they said to you incase you need to write it down for future existed similar conversation. Ask them in private and if you will ever get a good answer may Genesis be praised, some people butt and privates are just easier to understand if everyone being mean or sticking to the point. If not, the third head of the counsel will give you the best idea, depending on her mood. All of them know everything about their everyone and when they can vibe it will all come together to see what their land is. No stress and happiness vibes are all what will make them understand where their helping someone go. Imagine doing pottery with Jackson Pollock's masterpiece, however, small the piece is like, three small little atom things holding a big ol pot. They are are super helpful making sure it to clay and such, but you have to retie them after each try. So being able to see their axis makes all the difference in that one little piece of pottery and that's why seeking multiple opinions is a must. Just all makes sense and there will not be any stress in the execution of the pottery when you want something should be, in a literal sense, Such as helping someone find their land.",1,0
"If you asked any student to teach the current class subject is, the lesson would not be smooth or effective. However, if the teacher was to teach the subject, the lesson would be smooth and effective. The same goes for summer projects. Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers have an elevated understanding of the curriculum and have more experience with learning based projects, which make the projects more effective.

Firstly, teachers have more of an understanding of the curriculum because it is their job to plan and teach it to the students. Therefore, teachers have the ability to create a project that studies important or nuanced portions of their subject. Backed with superior expertise, the teacher's project will be better at guiding students towards understanding important topics. The teacher's better understanding of the curriculum will allow them to create a project that not only explores the surface of the topic, but one that can delve into the finer details.

Secondly, teachers have more experience teaching new subjects and topics to their students. Teachers understand the methods to teach students their subject because they have experience with the subject and teaching. Their experience allows them to create projects that present a topic in a manageable and understandable manner.

Proponents of student designed projects may argue that student designed projects will make students more passionate about the project. Although students may be more passionate, the construction of the project will be less efficient and lack teacher expertise, which may lead to failures in the project's effectiveness.

A teacher's superior subject understanding and teaching experience will lead to a better and more effective project than one built from a student's understanding and lesser teaching experience; summer projects should be designed by teachers.",0,1
"I think that if a student has a B average that they shouldn't be able to participate in sports because to some students, sports and school are just too much for them.

When students are trying to have good grades in school and be in sports at the same time, it gets too hard for them and their grades drop lower. If a student that want to play sports but has bad grades, they should work hard to get into the sports that they want to be in. They shouldn't just barely pass and be able to be in sports. Some kids work hard to get into sports, and when someone that just barely passed gets into sports, it makes the other kids mad because they worked so hard to get where they were.

Some kids think it's unfair that they couldn't get into sports because of their grades. They have to improve their grades to get what they want. And if they don't want to, then they shouldn't be allowed in sports.

So I think that students should work hard for what they want. I think it's only fair that students with an A average should have a choice to be in sports or not.",0,1
"Yes, I argree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students should try something new . They can see what activitys they like to do , they can become friends with new people, and they can do more hands on activitys.

Students can see what activity they like to do. Some students never done an activity before. So they may want wanna try something now. They may wanna try a sport they never did before. Students may already have a activity they like to do and they wanna keep doing it. Some people have a hard time trying to find what they like do.

Students can become friends with other people. Some people don't have friends and they wanna make friends. Some students have friends and their friends are doing a different activity. Some students don't wanna feel left out so they make friends.

Students can do more hands on activitys. Some students do better when its hands on. They like to be able to touch it and see it . Some students would rather heard it and can remember it like that.

Students should participate in one extrarricular activity. They can see what things they like to do, they can become friends with other people, and they can do more hands on activitys. They will wanna do it again and have fun.",0,1
"The human body is a complex network of muscles, bones, and organs to create one functioning person. These muscles, bones, and organs create diverse emotion whether it is through the face or through the body. The emotions help express themselves to others in order to relay their feelings to events or surroundings. A technology able to read a vast amount of emotions and help indicate their feelings would be incredibly beneficial to society as it would make understanding each other easier. This could help students in the long run by helping the school or instructor understand what interests them and what disinterests them by knowing their feelings to the emotions they convey.

The problem in schools around the country is the struggle to encapsulate a student's interest and maintaining it for numerous years. A technology that can help lead students in the correct direction, from the first day they step into a school, can lead to a more productive society. As Dr. Huang puts it, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too."" (D'Alto.) If we can use this technology, we will be able to put the expressions and emotions into words and percentages. This removes the barrier of people struggling to understand each other. This technology will pave the way to a brighter and more efficient world by making people interested and happy to do what they do from the first day.

Technology is the way of tomorrow and will help create a better world. A technology that helps understand human emotion consistently will be the next big advancement for communication and language. A student needs to be understood in order for he or she to understand. A program that can easily make that happen in a few seconds as opposed to several years can help everyone enjoy what they do a little more.",0,1
"Aliens

Some people don't believe in alien lifeforms on other planets; they would say, other planets can't support life there due to multiple things: no oxygen, water, food, etc. We scientist respond to this with, ""We have all those things here, there has to be some other planet like us.""

Humans need food, water, and air to live, but that doesn't mean that aliens do. They could be like plants and create their own food inside their bodies. As for water, NASA has discovered that there used to be water on the moon, so what is there to believe there couldn't be any water anywhere else.

People can be very religious and about the Bible and God, but other people can be all about evolution and not creation. If humans evolved from animals, then we might not be the only ones. Which means that if humans can evolve into humans, then other organisms can evolve, also.

The Face on Mars might be a butte or mesa, but that doesn't mean other organisms don't live outside of the Solar System. We can't leave here, so we won't ever be able to know. Life beyond Earth may be just a myth, but it also may be something truly amazing.",0,1
"There is an unfortunate lack of participation in extracurricular activities at our school. Moreover, the effects of vaping, gangs, depression, and procrastination have taken a toll on the student body. Seldom do I encounter a student who has not experienced some of the aforementioned issues. Therefore, I agree with this decision because extracurricular activities allow for new friendships to be made, students to focus more on school, and prevent students from engaging in illegal activities.

Extracurricular activities allow for new friendships to be made. It is no secret that children are social creatures, and they require constant interaction with one another. If there were to be mandatory extracurricular activities, their need to interact will be fulfilled. Students engaged in an extracurricular activity will likely find more friends they can connect with, as another student taking part in the same activity may have similar interests as them. This will be different from a classroom environment, in which there may be students who do not share the same interests and thus unable to befriend each other. Without a doubt, extracurricular activities will be able to satisfy a child's need for social interaction and making friends.

In addition to helping students make friends, extracurricular activities can assist students with staying focused on school. These activities may provide ample opportunities for classmates to meet up and discuss homework. They also would encourage students to complete their homework once the activity is over. Extracurricular activities keep students in a productive environment, further their work ethic, dissuade them from returning home to do nothing but stare at their phones for hours at a time, and encourage them to finish homework. When a student eventually moves on to become an adult with a job and a family, they can use the experience they had gained while working with others in an extracurricular activity to help them become a functioning member of society. Certainly, extracurricular activities are instrumental in helping a student grow into an studious man or woman.

Extracurricular activities prevent students from engaging in illegal activities. Gangs have made a resurgence in the school district lately, and students are partaking in crimes such as dealing drugs and vandalism. Furthermore, the teen vaping epidemic has severely impacted our school in particular. These illegal activities are fueled by depression, isolation, and bad grades. All of these issues can be rectified by implementing mandatory extracurricular activities. As mentioned above, extracurricular activities can provide students with ways to socialize and improve their academic situations. A troubled student may not be able to find time to meet with a gang or purchase a vaping device when they are involved in an extracurricular activity. Without any reason or time to break the law, order may be restored in the school and the consequences of gang violence and vaping may be avoided. Then, the troubled student can academically succeed and grow up to be a law abiding citizen.

I support the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of their ability to form new friendships between students, make students focus more on academics, and eliminate the possibility of students consistently breaking the law. After this rule is implemented, the school, no doubt, will become a much friendlier and productive place for students.    ",0,1
"Yes, it could be useful! It could be used to do a lot of good things. For example, we could use it to help us determine whether someone is lying or not during an interigation or in a court. However, in order or both of those to be accurate we would need to make some adjustments.

Nevertheless, the technology could be used to show how and when students in school become confused or bored with a subject, just like the author stated. It could also advance our understanding of how emotions work. The Mona Lisa, who we saw in the picture, looks like she has a weird cross between a smile and a frown. It is very fascinating how this all works. This can also tell us if celebrities and politicians are being truthful.

In conclusion, it could be very benifical to study this subject. It could further advance the science of the human face and emotions. Like the author said, who knew faces could reveal so much about our emotions.",0,1
"To many that think summer breaks should be all about having fun in the sun, I disagree. Summer projects ought to be student-designed because it helps students to be proactive, give their best, and see summer in a different light. When students help design their own projects, it gives another opportunity of doing what they will get in a standard classroom. They help to prioritize, plan, execute, and consider the consequences of everything they do. Although, some projects should be teacher-designed because they will give answers to more specific questions and topics, which projects designed by students would not be able to answer. Nowadays, technology is at it's all time high, students can help design projects that will help their chances of beating the competitions they will encounter in the future and they would be better prepared for high on demand jobs like coding and being programmers. It would be practical to have students work in group, have student-designed project topics, and teachers, peers, or mentors to critically review and offer feedback on the project idea, the planning process, and the implementation. They can also be graded using specific criteria standards determined by the teacher. Teachers could also be able to exert influence within the group, giving students guidance and mentoring all they need to get through to the end. With student-designed projects, they get a chance to be proud of what they have produced, and the students will be more motivated to put in more effort to see the project through.

When students design their own projects, they can choose subjects that intently interest them. They might design and execute a research question that they are passionate about, investigate the impacts of social media, design a calculative game they play, or build an automated mechanical computer device. Students can also choose how they go about their projects. They can use analyzing, critical thinking, problem solving, hypotheses, evidence, and many more skills. They can also choose the best way of presenting their projects, like presenting to an audience, and ultimately choose what to do with their project. While designing projects, they get the responsibility over their projects as they determine the topics they want to work on, what to do to achieve their dreams, and what to achieve everything they would like to accomplish and not what the teacher wants or what the system requires. With this given opportunity, students tend to come up with the best presentations and their projects tend to have the best outcomes and they tend to have more fun while working on their projects. Finally, by allowing students to design and execute their own projects, teachers can use the time to teach, support, and give feedback more intentionally. While students are taking the whole responsibility and working, teachers can observe the projects, help students develop time managing skills, and offer feedback that will improve their projects over time.

"To the principal:

I believe that the best cell phone policy is to allow students to have phone in school and allow them to use them during lunch periods and other free periods, so long as the phone are turned off during class time. Cell phones have become a near irreplaceable part of teens' lives today. The ability to be able to contact people at any place and moment in time is extremely important, to the point of being vital. For example, in case of an emergency, students would be able to contact their parents and the other people they would need to inform. Without this luxury- no, necessity- lives could be endangered. Moreover, students would be happier during school because they would be allowed to use their cell phones- at the right time, of course. Thus, students would have a more positive attitude during class, would work harder, and obtain better grades.

Now, i understand why cell phones are generally not accepted in classrooms. cell phones can be distracting in class; you can talk, text message, and IM friends; you can play games or use the internet. With all of the things you can do with that one machine, it's no wonder that cell phones are deemed a distraction in classrooms. However, if cell phones were permitted to be used during lunch periods and other free periods, I assure you that students' cell phones would not be a distraction during class time any longer. If cell phones were allowed to be used in class, the temptation to use them in class would no longer exist. The reason for that is people always want what they can't have. In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain says that in order to make something desirable to someone, you must make it difficult to obtain. Since it would not be difficult to use cell phones, there would not be a need to have them banned in class- and banning cell phones in class would cause cell phone usage to go up.

I hope that you consider changing the school's cell phone policy to be more lenient about cell phone usage, which would in turn give the school a more student-friendly environment.",0,1
"Dear Principal,

I think that Policy 1 is the best choice for our school. This policy states that ""students are allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during free time and at lunch as long as they are turned off in the classroom."" There are several reasons why I think this is the best choice for our school. Below are a few of them.

Firstly, I think you should choose this policy because being a student here, I know what its like to want to communicate with friends. I think that if you let us use our cell phone at lunch to communicate with friends, we will be less likely to be rude and obnoxious in the class room.

Second, as you may know, some cell phones are equipped with internet, music, cameras and other things that could keep a student busy at lunch time. In example, if a student has a cell phone that plays music, that person will sit quietly listening to music instead of other, disruptive things he might be pressured to do by his ""friends"".

Third, if a student has a cell phone that they are allowed to bring to school, it may make them more apt to attend school instead of sitting around all day playing on his or her phone.

I know that there are several negative points in allowing students to bring cell phones to school, such as classroom disruption, thefts and damages to mentioned devices, but in my opinion i think the more positive points that i have listed above outweigh the negative ones. So, in conclusion, I think that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school.

Thank you for listening,

Sincerely,

Student.",0,1
"By doing a Facial Action Coding to a classroom full of students would be different and interesring. This would be the first time anyone has done something that like. But the results could vary cause of how the students are feeling.

Say there is a girl who is having a really good day, she got asked to Prom and she said yes. It made her day and she was happy for the rest of the day. And then take a boy who was late for the bus and had to walk to school. He would be tired and upset. They both have two different emotions, so the results would be different.

Read this part of the article, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". If a classroom did a scan and all the students were tired, not interested, and ready to go home, the teacher could take those results and make the class more interesring for the students. The students would probably have more fun and want to do the work if the teacher made it fun and interesting for the students. But don't make it too difficult for the students cause they could shut down again.

By doing the Facial Action Coding, the result could be different for some students. But it would be fun and interesting to switch things up a bit and have while learning. By doing the Facial Action Coding, you can see how the students really feel. And it cpuld help them and you (the teacher) get a better understanding of how to teach.",0,1
"Hey, I'm Luke. I'm here to tell you about the Seagoing Cowboys program. I was a Seagoing Cowboy myself. It was a very unique experience. On the plus side, I also had a lot of spare time.

"Cars have become a part of our modern day culture since the invention of the first model. Many countries around the world have an abundance of car buyers and users, however others are taking into consideration alternatives. The advantages of limiting car usage include relief from stress of cars upon individuals and reduced emissions in the environment.

Cars put forth a lot of stressful trouble upon users. These vehicles are designed to transport a person or people from point A to point B, however cars are for personal use that can cost an immense amount of money. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter about her new ""carfree"" lifestyle Rosenthal,3. This ideology is spreading throughout all Europe as more alternate transportation are provided by the government. As Selsky mentioned in Source 3, locations, such as parks and sports centers with uneven sidewalks, have been replaced with broad, smooth ones for citizen's use. Moreover, many cities have provided a bicycle program to promote less usage of cars. These steps towards change help convince people that there are alternatives out there, and that we aren't limited to just buying a car and license to go to places.

Additionally, the limitation of car usage help establish a better and healthier environment for everyone. Cars emulate lots of dangerous gases that may harm our precious earth, many of which are responsible for the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect causes gases to be trapped in the atmosphere which harms our ozone layer and creates a smoglike appearance on our cities. Paris is an example of a polluted city as civilians battle against threatening smog from emissions of diesel cars in France Duffer,8. Many actions towards progressive behavior have increased the likelihood of limited car usage, such as tolls throughout cities and fines up to 25 for violators of laws. These enforcements will ensure that the environment is capable of maintaining generation after generation at a stable pace.

To conclude, many countries are pondering choices of opportunities to promote less usage of cars, while some are on their way to solve these issues, limitations on car usage have a variety of advantages for ourselves and the environment. These limits help reduce stressful situations, as well as provide a healthier ecosystem to live and prosper.",0,1
"Being a part of the Seagoing Cowboys was a great experience. I had no idea that it would be as much fun as it turned out to be. For me, this opportuninty meant being able to witness extraordinary places, while being able to help others. For others and yourself it could mean just the same.

I had a great deal of fun on my trip. It gave me an opportunity to see many countries that I may not have seen on any other basis, such as Venice, Italy as well as parts of China, Europe, and Greece. I also chose to spend my off time playing sports and games whenever the chance came along. Your down time; however, would be entirely up to you though, but these are some unique places and things to consider exploring.

My down time was not the most important part of the trip though. It also gave me an opportuntiy to aid others as well as animals, who's homes where left in ruins. After getting this chance to so something more in my life, I knew that this was a great thing that I had invested my time into.

Extensively, I would recomend this as a career path to any who are interested. The years that I was a Seagoing Cowboy, were a great few years in my life.

"Driverless cars would be good addition to the world. One of those reasons is that a smart can have better reaction times than a normal human driver. A smart car can also help with traffic jams. Smart cars also make sure the driver is holding onto the wheel and alert at all times.

Automakers used the speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of antilock brakes. Those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Other improvements to make driving are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.

BMW announced a smart car that can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. That means that the human driver must be alert at all times and be ready to take over when the situation requires.

A smart car can have better reaction times than a human driver and a smart car can help with traffic jams. Those are just two of the reasons why driverless cars are a good idea.",0,1
"I disagree with the moves to change to election by popular vote.

The electoral college ""is good for the voters in many ways; from a election analysis in source 3, electors frequently force presidential candidates to visit key states, where normally they would have no reason to travel; little or no media coverage; a few voters from a big state overbalances the effect of 20,000 voters in a very small state; the electoral college of five voters in congress provides an interesting bicameral check; and this device probably will continue to give executives public recognition, exert prudential restraints, and tend to encourage a sound campaign."" Not only do these advantages outweigh the advantage of the popular vote, but on the contrary the electoral college process favor different candidates to the american people. What a voter knows about another is obviated by the division of their electoral vote to his commissioners; and the communityinvolvement in direct election projects is obviated by the division of the electoral vote.""

"Over the last two decades, cell phones have become very popular. Today, almost everyone has a cell phone, especially if they are old enough to drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a big controversy over the last few years and many people have faced the consequences of texting, calling, or searching their cell phones while operating a vehicle. With that being said, there are several reasons why people should not use their phones while driving. These reasons can be classified into a couple of different categories, including safety and legal reasons.

The first reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in injury or death for the driver or someone else. This could pose a safety hazard and would therefore fall under the safety category. Statistically, there are 1.6 million car crashes that are caused by texting and driving each year. Almost 390,000 injuries each year from accidents involve a cell phone or other device. Also, 1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the U.S. Therefore, there is always a risk that an accident will happen as a result of cell phone use and could harm anyone involved in the accident.

The second reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in property damage for the driver or someone else, which could pose a safety hazard but could also result in someone pressing charges. Therefore, this could be classified under the safety category and the legal category. As mentioned above, crashes due to cell phone use while driving are very common in the United States. It can cause damage to other vehicles, houses, and or company buildings. Whatever your insurance doesn't cover you have to pay out of pocket and these damages can get really expensive. Any insurance claim could also cause your monthly payments to go up.

The last reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it is against the law in many states such as Georgia, which would fall under the legal category. On July 1, 2018, Georgia passed a Hands-Free law that basically says that anyone driving a motor vehicle on a highway in Georgia is not allowed to hold a phone with any part of their bodies. A first-time offense for using a cell phone and driving is $50, the second is $100, and the third is $150. Each offense after the third one is also $150 each. Every offense is a misdemeanor that would go on your permanent record.

There are multiple reasons why you should not use your phone while driving. This distracted driving can lead to car wrecks that could cause harm to you, to someone in your car, or to anyone else involved in the accident. An accident could also cause damage to your car, to someone else's car, or to homes, buildings, and other property damage. It is also illegal in many other states so if you are caught you could be fined up to $150 and it would go on your permanent record. Because of these potential safety hazards and legal issues, it is best to not use a cell phone while driving a vehicle.   ",0,1
"Texting & Driving

Texting while driving, also called texting and driving, is the act of composing, sending, reading text messages, email, or making similar use of the web on a mobile phone while operating a motor vehicle. Texting while driving is considered extremely dangerous by many people, including authorities, and in some places have either been outlawed or restricted. As a form of distracted driving, texting while driving significantly increases the chances that a driver will be involved in a motor vehicle accident.

Research by the NHTSA suggested that an estimated 660,000 drivers use their phones during daytime driving. According to a report issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation, drivers between the ages of 20 to 29 are the most likely to text while driving. The International Telecommunication Union states that ""texting, making calls, and other interaction with in-vehicle information and communication systems while driving is a serious source of driver distraction and increases the risk of traffic accidents""

The scientific literature on the dangers of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or driving while texting, is limited but growing. A systematic review study at the Queensland University of Technology Centre for Accident Research and Road

Safety-Queensland CARRS-Q found that visual-manual interactions such as texting and browsing have a detrimental effect on a number of safety-critical driving measures. Specifically, negative effects were seen in detecting and responding correctly to road signs, detecting hazards, time spent with eyes off the road, and lateral position. Mean speed, speed variability, lateral position when receiving text messages, and following distance showed no difference. A separate, yet unreleased simulation study at the University of Utah found a sixfold increase in distraction-related crashes when texting.

The low number of scientific studies may be indicative of a general assumption that if talking on a mobile phone increases risk, then texting also increases risk, and probably more so. 89% of U.S. adults think that text messaging while driving is ""distracting, dangerous and should be outlawed"". The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety has released polling data that show that 87% of people consider texting and emailing while driving a ""very serious"" safety threat, almost equivalent to the 90% of those polled who consider drunk driving a threat.

Despite the acknowledgement of the dangers of texting behind the wheel, about half of drivers 16 to 24 say they have texted while driving, compared with 22 percent of drivers 35 to 44. A survey of more than 90 teens from more than 26 high schools throughout the United States conducted by Liberty Mutual Insurance Group in 2006 showed that 46% of students consider texting to be either ""very"" or ""extremely"" distracting. An American Automobile Association study showed that 34% of teens admitted to being distracted behind the wheel because of texting and 40% of American teens say they have been in a car when the driver used a cell phone in a way that put people in danger. A study involving commercial vehicle operators conducted in September 2009 concluded that though incidence of texting within their data set was low, texting while driving increased the risk of accident significantly.

"Hello I think this technology could be very valuable as well as normal it can actually be used out the same way. I see the author show that the system could actually be used other many ways but reading the emotions of students in a classroom can help the teacher understand what they're dealing with and know how uncomfortable or bored there student are. It would can also be then to observe and understand how them student are interacting with each other, because even if it doesn't outwardly show anymore mona lisa smile there is a certain way to tell if a person is bored of your lesson, if it can pick up on all these emotions it could really help every student get the education they need to succeed, so even if the coworker is getting boisterous it could have enough information to write an essay, on whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could ever be beneficial.

This is a great response because it completes the requested instruction. It uses specific details from the article and like ""Mona Lisa"" to support their essay, and insightfully get into the motivation of the authors point. This is an appropriate response.",1,0
"Thank you for giving students the opportunity to communicate with you. It is very unfair to make me product in sports or other activities. If that happens, some of my best friends will not be able to do what there favorite things and that is just not fair. When your a student on him team when you are on the team you have not really B average because most of the time the times that its there school work you might not do what you have to do as fast as you did your teachers work or what you do when you're taking care for other things like keep your bedroom clean or is order pick you up when you are lazy around the house or drinking Friday, but most of the time students like me would really do what we got to do after we finish our practice we will make it on the right time every day this will have a B average that's why we are winning every game.

I listened as he lived through much inlcuding the trips he made with the seagoing cowboys. The trips were nothinh short of mind blowing. The idea that Luke spent time sailing around America was fantastic. My mind was stuck onrian on the image from the photo of the young boy the same age Luke was, necking the side of a horse in the in Massachustts beach after his third trip down there under the program. After seeing that i couldn't help myself but join a community to live out my dreams doing the same things Luke and many plus others did and by doing so I hope to tell my stories in the style Луcius, There is nothing else that can give you a better american xperince than sailing down America and seeing all these mighty sights. When I was looking into the program, I was surprised by the lack of funding. I really think it is a great opportunity when it comes to seagoing cowobys and I hope I can be part of any future ones. I hope I can contribute the way the current members do and be one of the official photographers for the program. Also, I'm a singer and I hope they will allow me the chance to sing some traditional seagoing cowboy songs. The second when they come, or go to the departure ceremony, they will hear it. Looking at the whole experience gave me chills down my spiness. It was more than just being outdoors. As stated in the article, the program is powerful on its own, but its people are what make it truly special. As soon as I met anyigbo with the program, I was HOOK.

"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Responsibility of Texting and Driving

Cell phones are everywhere! Everyone has a phone or some type of electronic device. These devices are very useful, but they can also be a distraction. Driving is a freedom that many people look forward to obtaining in their lives, but it is also a major responsibility. Some things go together, like peanut butter and jelly, but cellphones and driving are not a good match.

Driving and texting is one of the number one causes of traffic accidents.

Drivers should not be able to utilize their cell phone at any time while operating a vehicle because it distracts them from the road and decreases their awareness.

Cell phones can be useful while driving, but they can lead to distractions. Many people use cell phones to get directions when they are lost or stream music.

The apps that are used to give directions and to listen to music are great, but the notifications from other social media apps can be a major distraction. According to the NY Post, ""Americans check their phone on average once every 12 minutes - burying their heads in their phones 80 times a day"" (NYP).

This study was done in 2017.

People check their phones more now than they did back in 2017 because there are more apps that people can download on their phones.

If phones were just used for giving directions or listening to music while driving, it would be okay, but everyone does not think to turn off their notifications so their phones become a major distraction. Therefore, it is a safer option to just not use the phone at all while driving.

Not only are phones a major distraction, they decrease awareness and slow a person's reaction.

When a person is driving, they have to pay attention to their surroundings and quickly respond when other drivers drive recklessly. If someone is on their phone, their awareness is decreased and they do not respond as quickly as they would if they did not have their phone in their hand.

The only thing that drivers should be focused on is the steering wheel and road.

In the end, using a phone while driving can cause accidents because it is a major distraction and it decreases awareness. When people use their phones and drive, they are putting their life and the lives of other people at risk. Even the most aware drive can get distracted by their phone. Using the phone for just a few seconds while driving can result in a major accident that could kill multiple people. The safest option for everyone is to simply stop, park, and use the phone.          ",0,1
"Do you think a world with driverless cars would be safe? Well, if you ask me, my answer is no. Let's look at my reasoning as to why.

In the article we read, the author says that some car manufacturers are ""bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays"". I, for one, don't think ""heads up displays"" are a great idea. I mean, we may as well put mini televisions in the steering wheels while we're at it! In addition, GM's new vibrating seem less than lovely. Do you want your designated driver's seat massaging them to sleep? I most certainly do not. It just does not seem safe! Are we gonna start showering with the help of robots? I think taking away the privilege of driving is not good. It makes it seem like such a chore. What will teenagers look forward to? Where is the responsibility? Imagine how you felt when you finally turned and sixteen and got to get your hands on a wheel. It must be a feeling like no other! While it is a cool thought, we must really think these thing through, people! Think of the people who have jobs in public transportation. What will they do to support their families when they lose their job to a robot? Driverless can potentially ruin the lives of many.

All in all, I think the negatives outweigh the positives in this situation. Say NO to driverless cars! In a world where everything operates itself, it's nice to have a little responsibility. ",0,1
"Dear Senator,

Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.

Foremost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winner-take-all"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.

The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.

Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.

Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.

Yours,

"When someone asks for advice, they already have some ideas in their head as to what the right solution might be. Asking multiple people you trust for their advice only helps confirm what you think is the right answer or provides several different options. Sometimes when you talk to someone you realize you had not also considered a different solution. You might ask one person who is a friend, but then you have someone you trust who is an expert in the field, such as a former supervisor. You can ask another person to get you thoughts from someone who is an outsider and hopefully can provide a more fair and objective point of view than someone who is emotionally attached and might be biased. These different viewpoints can help someone make a better choice because they are not limited to one perception of a problem.

Having someone who's an expert in that field, your former supervisor, could be one of the most helpful opinions because they have a real understanding of what the outcome of a decision may be and can specifically tell you if it's a good or a bad idea. I had a friend who asked five people for their advice because she was trying to decide on changing jobs. She had been talking to her friend for a couple of months about that, but her friend was very influenced by the fear of other people, so ultimately, her friend would not recommend her to take that step, although the step was reasonable and was looked upon as ""safe"" by two people she asked who worked in that particular field, and a former supervisor of hers all advised her that it could make her career even better and open her up to so many new opportunities. One person outside the field could tell that it was a good thing she had thought of since it was a somewhat new field for her, but the supervisor knew it would be a good fit for someone with her skill sets. In the final decisions, her friend's advice was one of them and she did change jobs to a field she completely fell in love with and has been doing great, which, in the end, illustrates why it's a good idea to ask multiple people for advice. Asking for opinions from different people with different backgrounds and experiences can lead you to a better choice because it takes the decision from just a perspective based on friendship or bias when it comes to someone with their own set of opinions with their own set of experiences into a better decision based on the most information available.        ",1,0
"As a member of the Seagoing Cowboys program, I think it would be an excellent experience for others if they participate. They should join the program because it is a great learning experience. It would allow people to work hard while having fun. It would be a positive experience for those people.

First of all, it would give people experience working with animals. They would be able to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that are being shipped overseas. They would learn what it takes to keep the animals alive. Taking care of the animals would be a beneficial experience for those people.

Next, they would be traveling constantly and getting unbelievable opportunities. They would also be able to have some fun. They could have fun by sightseeing and playing games with the other members. It would be a mix between working hard and having fun.

Finally, they would learn about people in other countries and their needs after a war. They would be able to help those people by giving them animals, food supplies, and more. They would see what it is like to live in another country after a war. It would be a great experience for the newest members of the Seagoing Cowboys.

In conclusion, the people who join the Seagoing Cowboys would have a positive experience. They would be able to work with animals, take care of the animals, and learn what they need to survive. They would also be constantly traveling, and they would work hard and have some time to have fun. they would learn about people in other countries and their needs.

"Extracurricular activities are good for everyone. For example you might want to go into acting or sports. You might just want to try something new. You might think that something is boring but then you end up liking it. Just like how I never thought I would like basketball but I tried out for the team. Turns out I do like basketball and I think I'm pretty good at it.

Have you ever wanted to try something new but don't know where to start? Well, join a club. You get to meet new people and you get to try something new. If you think you like something else better you can always join that club. You might even be surprised by how much you like it.

I have sometimes thought that I would never play basketball. My parents always thought softball was my sport. Until I saw my brother playing basketball and thought that it looked fun. So, I played on an AAU basketball team. It was so much fun to play and to meet new friends. So, I quit softball and now I play basketball. But, I still have friends from my softball team.

Now, say you a new student at a new school. Like anyone else you would like to make new friends. So, why don't you join a club? Everyone in that club likes the same interests as you. You would make friends right away. Even if you quit everyone in that club will still be your friend. You can move to a different club and make friends there.

So, yes I do agree that students must participate in an extracurricular activity. They get to try something new. They could try something that they think the don't like but then actually do. They can make new friends. So I think it is a good choice for students to take extracurricular activities.",0,1

"I think driverless cars are a great invention. Driverless cars would make everyone's lives easier. It would save lots of time, and even keep people safer. I think everyone should have access to self driving cars. This technology could help us improve our lives, and open a new world of technology for us.

I strongly agree with Google cofounder, Sergy Brin, on his ideas about public transportation. Public transportation systems that self drive would be amazing. It would indeed change the world. These cars would make transportation extremely easy, and replace old cars.

These cars could also make driving even more safer for people. The self driving cars have sensors that can auto brake. This could prevent many accidents in the future, and maybe save lives. Although this technology may help, it all lies on the driver. This technology may cause carless drivers. All in all, the technology of driverless cars could make driving safer than it is today.

Overall, I think that driverless cars are a good idea. They are safer for people, and young drivers. Also, they are just convienient for us. It would improve out quality of life. I would like to see these care implemented into our daily lives.",0,1
"So, I was walking down the street the other day, in my NASA uniform, when a conspiracy theorist stops me to ask me a few questions about the Face on Mars.
