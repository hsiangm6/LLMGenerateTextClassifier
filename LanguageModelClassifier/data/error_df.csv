"What makes a mistake something someone will never do again? It is usually the outcome of the mistake. It is what went wrong, but the problem with texting and driving is that it is not always something that goes wrong, but when it does go astray, it is usually life-threatening. How are people supposed to learn from an outcome that has never happened to them? The first step of learning from a mistake is to own the mistake, but it is hard to own a mistake when it does not feel like one. Well, the easiest way is to learn from someone else's mistake.

Liz Marks was a popular girl, a model even, but that all stopped when she used her phone while driving. She read a one-word text before she even had time to respond; she had crashed into a truck. Liz had to be airlifted from the accident to the University of Baltimore Shock Trauma Center, and the first responders did not even think she would make it. She ended up spending a month in the ICU to have various surgeries. After that, she spent another three months at the Kennedy Krieger Institute relearning reading, writing, walking, talking, swallowing, and chewing. She survived, but she has severe facial trauma. She is blind in one eye, cannot smell, has lost some of her hearing, cannot even make her tears, and cannot sleep without medication.

Alexandra Mansonet was found guilty of vehicular manslaughter after she killed someone while texting and driving. The lawyer stated, ""It's going to be very difficult for her to deal with the fact that at sentencing she could be incarcerated for something we are all guilty of doing on a daily basis."" She was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Not only does she have to spend ten years in prison for something that almost everyone does, but she will forever have to live with the guilt of knowing her actions killed someone. She will always know that her texting back that she wanted Mexican food led to a woman dying. Alexandra was not a bad person.

She was the chief executive at a nonprofit and had won awards or her extensive work with troubled youth. She could be replaced by almost anyone in this situation. It only takes a little bit of bad luck and a decision that 240,900,000 people make a year to end someone's life.

How deadly is texting while driving? The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that in America alone, approximately 660,000 people try to use their phones while driving everyday. This averages 240,900,000 people a year, which is 5% more than the number of licensed people in America. According to the NHTSA, between 2014 and 2017, 1,366 people died from crashes involving drivers using cell phones. 1,300 people are enough to constitute a massacre, a massacre where the weapon used was the send button. A massacre composed of people saying what they want to eat, and when they are going to arrive, that is if they end up at their destination. A massacre made up of people just like any other people.

People who never thought it would happen to them.

Every time someone looks at their phone while driving, it's a gamble. One where the wager is their life versus something as trivial as what kind of music they want to listen to or what they want to eat for dinner. Unfortunately, some of them never make it there. It is a question people have to ask themselves: Would you rather lose a minute of your life or your life in a minute?   ",0,1
" My first opinion,

would be that to be a good person,

is you have to be your self no matter what is going to happen. For example a good behavior star at home because your parents have the responsibility to educate. Also some people said the students are very bad for other students, like they are bad influence.

My second, reason would be the your own problems can affect, your career. For example your grades at school if you are a good person with other people to be a good citizen just be you because people the just talk never do something good. But sometimes teen don't deserve what they have for example school, job, people the they love them.

After that well, if you work that is a good idea because you can focus, and two things but if you are weak that will be a terrible decision. So a good behavior is excellent, because you always can find friends, and maybe a girlfriend but den pent of you.

In conclusion, if you are a good behavior you will be a good person, and the future, and a good guide for you children. Also if you are a good students,you will be have credit for college but you have to be a good behavior. So the mean, that you responsibility is work very hard to complete your goals. And help other people, who need help because the would make you a good behavior.",1,0
" Last week, I had a math test on my first period. I prepared well for the test, but on that day, I woke up late, and I realized I got late for my school. I also have missed my school bus; therefore, I had to walk the whole way to my school. I was tired and tensed. As a result, I couldn't do well in that test, but if I was taking online class, I could take the test from home and be able to not get into all this trouble. Online classes can save us from getting into all this kind of problems and save our time also. Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because sometimes, students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class, actually students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities.

Those who believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons.

They say sometimes students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class. For example, if they get a project or assignment, some students may have trouble in understanding how to do/complete that assignment or sometimes, they might not understand a topic from a lecture in online class.

However, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time. For example, if I get sick, I don't need to miss school. I can stay at home and take my classes from home. Again, if I'm not at home or may be I'm at my relative's place or my friend's place, I'll be still able to attend those classes.

Also, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because by taking online classes, high school students can save",1,0
"Dear State Senator, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept and not changed. With the Electoral College, the presidential candidates can not have transregional appeal. The Electoral College also reduces the risk of a runoff election, where no candidate wins a majority of the votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral college vote is also less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This system also encourages voters in tossup states to be more thoughtful with their vote. The Electoral college also helps in balancing out the weight that large states with a large population lose.

With the Electoral College, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This not only makes the votes more fair, but it also encourages the presidential candidate to be desirable to all regions, not just one that that the candidate knows will vote for him. A candidate with only regional appeal would likely cause residents of the other regions to feel that their votes do not count.

The Electoral College reduces the risk that no candidate wins a majority of the votes and instead, usually produces a clear winner. An example of this, as stated by Richard Posner in his argument in defending the Electoral college, is when Nixon and Clinton were elected. Both had only 43 percent plurality of popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. The Electoral College also avoids creating pressure when no candidate wins a majority of the votes.

As said by Posner, voters in tossup states who know they are going to decide the election are likely to pay close attention to the campaign and will be more thoughtful with their vote. They also will have received the most information and attention from the candidates. It also makes sense that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The weight in the political balance that large states with a large population lose is balanced by the Electoral College. An example ,given by Posner, is that the popular vote in Florida was very close in 2012, but Obama, who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes. The same margin in a smaller state would result in the winner getting alot less votes. This causes large states to get more attention from candidates than a small state does.

In coclusion, I would like to say that keeping the Electoral College is a great choice. It will make presidential elections more fair and balanced than purely relying on a popular vote. The Electoral College produces more thoughtful votes, which intern will result in the best candidate for the people to have as president.",0,1
"I feel like the presidential election should be decided by popular vote. This way seems easier to handle and simplier. The electoral college is to complex for some people and the popular vote is easier to count and manage. The popular vote is the best way to decide the presidential election because it shows what the people want and you dont want a not liked president. A not liked president could be bad for the economy and it could possibly cause havoc and chaos.

The electoral college is to complex and unfair. The presidential election should be based on who the people like and vote for not a state of electors. The electoral college is unfair because the candidate that most people want to be president might not win because of the state of electors who could betray the presidential candidate and vote for a diffrent presidential candidate.

the popular vote is easier to handle and manage.

"Votes for the president of the United States are counted each election in two ways, the popular vote and the Electoral College. The popular vote is the people's vote, which allows our democratic nation to vote for their leader themselves, and the Electoral College is dependent upon the popular vote, and casts electoral votes based on the number of Representatives and Senators each state has in Congress Source One. People have consistently debated over whether or not this was a fair election process, due to the fact that the people's votes do not directly go to the president. Because of this, many people want the Electoral College to be gone, and people have attempted to abolish it in the past. The Electoral College should be abolished and the US should adopt the popular vote system as their only system because we live in a democratic nation, the current electoral voting process may not represent the popular vote, and it's a more fair system.

As citizens of the United States of America, we depend on the fact that we live in a free nation that values our justice, liberty, and voice. Included within our voice, we also depend on our democracy, that allows us to have say in who runs our country and how. It's important that we take advantage of this voice we have in the government, and it's also important we are represented fairly within it. When we depend on electors from the Electoral College to vote for who our states popular votes went to, they may not be doing that. They ultimately can decide who they are voting for, and if they decide to vote for the opponent, no one can stop them. It's very easy for them to betray our trust without our awareness Source Two. Source Three also states that ""that trust is rarely betrayed,"" which makes it clear that although uncommon, there have been incidents in the past where the citizens have been represented unfairly. In a democratic nation, we should have true sovereignty and be able to cast our popular vote, and know that it is being counted and included in the final say of our leader.

Overall, the Electoral Vote may not represent the Popular vote. As mentioned, there have been incidents in the past that have indicated the truthfulness of this statement. For example, in 1960 John F. Kennedy was almost opposed by unfair elections due to our country's people being misrepresented Source Two. Even if the popular vote of our state goes one way, the ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" Source Two. The electors are unreliable and may go one way just because they please to do so while leaving the faithful citizens in the dust with their decisions and votes meaning nothing. The popular vote system would better represent the people than the unreliable Electoral College system we have now.

The popular vote system is a more fair system, one of many reasons being that it would eliminate the advantage large and ""swing"" states have over others. Currently, ""swing"" states are being given more attention to be the candidates because the candidates realize that the fate of their presidency may be dependent upon these states Sources Two and Three. Since the Swing states are the ones who's votes can go either way, the candidates spend more time with these states in order to insure their likelihood to achieve the states electoral votes. This is not a fair process because the other states are not getting to know the candidates like these states do. The same thing goes for large states. Since the number of electoral votes you have is dependent upon population, the larger states have more electorsrepresentatives. Therefore, the presidential candidates want to achieve as many electoral votes as possible and will make sure to appeal to the larger states, leaving the smaller states at a disadvantage due to misrepresentation. The popular vote system would take everyone into account evenly, and therefore represent everyone fairly, and make for a better voting system.

All in all, the current Electoral College system is unfair, misrepresented, and unappealing to a democratic nation. The system should be abolished for all of these reasons, and allow the popular voting system to come in to play. The popular vote system would allow each citizen to be represented equally, and create a more level and fair environment. It's important that a democratic nation feels like one, and that we are all represented fairly, and there's no better way to do so than by being our own representatives.",0,1
"With the growth of technology, options, other than the traditional schooling, have developed, leaving schools to wonder if they should adapt to the new technologies by allowing classes to be attended online via video conference. Although some may believe otherwise, students can benefit from being able to attend online class from home because students can manage their time and can work at their own pace.

First of all, students will benefit from online class because they can manage their own time. For instance, my friend Generic_Name, who is a dancer and soccer player, takes classes online, so she has more time to attend her ballet classes and club soccer practices everyday. Because Generic_Name does not have to get dressed or commute to and from school, she can focus that additional time to dedicate to her interest in dance and sports while still maintaining her education. In addition, after my ACL and meniscus surgery, I had to take a week off of school to recover, which is a difficult amount of time to miss when being enrolled in all AP and honors courses. In preparation for my surgery, I asked all my teachers for notes and assignments that I would be missing, however, I only anticipated to miss half a week, so I was two days behind on my school work. With online classes, I could have managed more time to allow for a proper recovery and would not have fallen behind. Thus, online classes are useful in facilitating the growth of other interests and compensating for states of emergency where one may not be able to physically attend school.

Secondly, students will benefit from attending class online because they can work at their own pace. In U.S. History, for instance, my teacher Generic_Name would talk through the notes very quickly, so it was difficult for me to keep up, especially since I am a slow writer. Fortunately, Generic_Name makes the powerpoints available on blackboard, so I use that during class, but I am so invested in trying to write down all the notes that I miss the important information that he was explaining. In this situation, it would have been beneficial to attend that class from home because I could listen to his lecture intently and then take the notes afterward, which I would not have been able to do in class because Generic_Name disapproves of people not taking notes. Additionally, precalculus is a particularly easy class for me, so I often find myself sitting at my desk doing nothing after finishing the practice problems early. If I were to attend class online, I would be able to finish the lesson quickly and efficiently, shortening a 90 minute lesson to 30. Therefore, online courses enables students to utilize the time needed to take in and comprehend a lesson.

Some may disagree that students should be able to attend class online because students may easily get distracted at home, making their learning ineffective. This reasoning is plausible, however, in my experience, there are far more distractions at school than at home in isolation. For instance, in my Spanish class, the students were extremely loud and talkative because their was a substitute teacher, which affected me, a student who actually wanted to learn, since my mind could not properly process the information with all the noise in the room. When I got home from school, I worked on the assignment that I couldn't finish in class and was able to do it in only fifteen minutes because I could think more clearly with nothing but the serene silence filling up the room. Furthermore, in AP psychology, I sit next to my best friend Generic_Name, and, despite my best efforts to pay attention in class, I get distracted because the two of us talk and goof around, whereas, at home, I can concentrate on my work for hours when I am alone. Overall, distractions like friends and disruptive classmates can make learning in school difficult, so taking class from home in isolation may be even more effective than physically being in school.

To conclude, students can reap many benefits from online classes that would facilitate their growth both in and out of school. Attending class online gives the student control of learning in a way that is preferrable to them, which is important because then students will comprehend more and learn effectively, and gives the opportunity to explore interests with the extra time at hand to grow as an individual. It would be an absolute waste of resources if schools failed to take advantage of such technologies that could improve students' education and well-being. Not only is the availability of online classes beneficial to the students, but it is useful in an emergency such as a threat of a school shooting, which is unfortunately a prominent issue and possibility in the modern world, or a viral outbreak. Technology has changed drastically from when the school system was first established and normalized and so has society, so it's imperative that the schools take action to adapt to the changing world, especially now in the wake of a global pandemic. ",0,1
"I think that if a student has a B average that they shouldn't be able to participate in sports because to some students, sports and school are just too much for them.

When students are trying to have good grades in school and be in sports at the same time, it gets too hard for them and their grades drop lower. If a student that want to play sports but has bad grades, they should work hard to get into the sports that they want to be in. They shouldn't just barely pass and be able to be in sports. Some kids work hard to get into sports, and when someone that just barely passed gets into sports, it makes the other kids mad because they worked so hard to get where they were.

Some kids think it's unfair that they couldn't get into sports because of their grades. They have to improve their grades to get what they want. And if they don't want to, then they shouldn't be allowed in sports.

So I think that students should work hard for what they want. I think it's only fair that students with an A average should have a choice to be in sports or not.",0,1
"Not everyone can do things without any help. Some people need others to support them. When you make difficult choices, you always want advice before it actually happens. Sometimes people aren't sure of themselves, and they might not think that only one person is trustworthy enough. People talk to more than one person for advice because they want to make a better choice. They want to hear what other people have experienced, their personal feelings about the situation, the pros and cons, how they view everything, so they don't feel anxious about it as much. No one wants to do something when they don't know what will come out of it, and not only one person can help them. Sometimes people just need more assurance before they do something big, and talking to more people helps them a lot more than one person can alone. People talk to more than one person because they want their choice to be the best and most beneficial choice no matter what.

Everyone has lived a different life, whether you were rich or poor, healthy or ill, no one has lived the same life as another. When you need help making a choice, you talk to people because they haven't lived exactly like you. They haven't lived exactly like anyone. I would need to know what other people have spectated or experienced when they have had to make a choice similar to mine because I don't want one person to help. I want more people to help advise me because they might have experienced more than I have. You get more wisdom to make your choice when you hear more experiences. They view things differently than someone else. Getting more than one opinion makes sure you don't hear just point of view. It opens your eyes to many other things instead of being one-sided. Everyone has experienced different things in their lives, so not a single opinion alone will be correct. You would need many experiences to truly know what can happen from your choice.

People have anxiety when making hard choices. They always think of all the things that could go wrong in the process. Talking to one person doesn't always help, some people might think their opinion isn't enough. I don't always trust my opinion or my judgment. I need others to make me feel safe and secure, so that I can really trust what I'm doing. I don't want to make a choice when I'm anxious because then I will regret it later. I know I wouldn't be in the right mindset to make a choice if I'm anxious, so talking to more than one person would relieve most of my stress and anxiety. If you talk to only one person, you only get one of everything. You don't know everything that might happen, so you don't really know if you're doing the best thing. No one should make a choice when they are not sure about it. They should always feel that their choice was the best that they could have done. When you talk to more than one person, you know more the possible outcomes. You don't think about everything that can go wrong, but instead you think about all the things that you're doing right. You make your choice in the best mindset when you're not anxious.

You always want to know the pros and cons of things, but it is normally hard to find them on your own. Talking to one person doesn't always help because they are also just one person. Putting multiple minds together to think of pros and cons will give spectacular outcomes. Sometimes I need all the facts, pros, and cons. My mind and others needs help to come up with these pros and cons because we have a lot on our minds already about making the decision itself. We would be preparing to actually do it. I know I wouldn't be able to do it all on my own. I know I would need multiple people to help me because sometimes people aren't feeling their best. They might not be able to help you find all the pros and cons, but bringing together multiple people ensures that you get the facts you want. I wouldn't want to make a choice without knowing the cons of it. I want to know all the bad things that might happen even if it's for the best so that I can prepare for it. You would also get more detailed and possibly more profound pros and cons. You get all the facts when you work with more people, because more minds means more knowledge.

Everyone needs a support system, whether it's family or friends. When you ask for advice, you go to multiple people for help. You ask them for things to help you make your choice. I want people behind me to help me after I make my choice. If the choice knocks me down in any way, I want people to be there to support me. If I talk to multiple people, I know all of those people will help me if I fall. No one wants to feel alone after their choice. I would only make a tough choice if I was certain I had at least one person to help me. If I talked to more than one person, I know at least one of them will be able to support me because they helped me. They know what I was going through when I was making this choice. Talking to more than one person ensures that you have at least one person to fall back on after you made your choice.

No one knows if they're doing the right thing. Sometimes they don't trust them self, sometimes they're too anxious, and sometimes they just need more people to support them. Talking to more people helps you make the best choice. You know what you're doing is for the best. You know that you heard what might happen, you've seen things through other points of view, you aren't anxious when you make your choice, and you know people have your back. Talking to more people helps you make a better choice because no one can do everything alone. If you talk to more people, you trust them and yourself even more. You know what you're up against and you know what will come out of it. Asking more than one person for advice does wonders for you.

After you talk to people you trust, you know what you're doing is the best you can do, and you know that your choice gives you the best outcome possible.                    ",0,1
"Things aren't always as they appear, just because it looks that way doesn't necessarily mean that it is that way. The formation on Mars does look like a face but it is just a land formation it's not like land formations are rare. Coincidences happen all the time, this is just one of those times. You can't judge something based on how it's looked, you have to really pay attention.

Formations are a very common thing, both on Earth and on Mars. It is nothing strange, what is strange is that it looks like a head. But even at the picture was taken in 1976 with a much lower quality of camera so things wouldn't have looked as clear as a more modern camera, the other picture was taken in 2001, technology would have advanced and improved much in that time span as it was 25 years later. The quality would have improved so it would have been much easier to see and to know what it really was, it was just a coincidence and coincidences are just as common as land formations.

Coincidences happen a lot, and this is just one of the instances that it happens. It may look like a face and something that was made but when you look at it again, with a different perspective you see what it really is. Like sometimes you will have food, like chips and it will look like a face or an object, but just because it looks like that doesn't mean that is that. Or sometime you will see something, but then have to look again to see if that's really what you saw, it's the same concept. Just because you see it doesn't mean it is that or that is even there. Magic is a good example as it is just an illusion, it's happening in front of you but that doesn't mean it's actually there, because when you see how it's really done it's not so magic. The clouds may look like animals floating in the sky but they are still just clouds. All of this brings it back to the same point, that the land formation may look like a face that was created but when you really look at it and realize what it is you know what it really is, just another land formation.

You may say that aliens made something like this but that just doesn't make sense. That's like saying that people made the Grand Canyon or that people made the Rocky Mountains. These things would have made by what was there and things that affected them, not by people or aliens. There is no evidence that aliens even exist, so with lacking that proof how can you say something that never existed or at least something that is unable to be proved existed made this.

It all loops and loops and loops. You end up with the same thing and it just becomes repetitive. You can say that aliens made this but you lack proof, where as it's just a land mass has plenty of evidence to back it up. It is just a coincidence that it looked like a face.",0,1
"When it comes to making a choice it can be hard, don't worry others can help. Don't be too overwelmed because your peers will lead the way. Getting other people's advice is key to getting the best outcome. I know personally I look up to my peers for advice. Here's how it can help you make the best choice.

First, your peers know you. Most of your close friends and family have known you for awhile. Your family sees the way you work and truly knows all about you. It's important to get advice from them because they will help you make the best choice. Others also see you from a different point of view so it's not all about the way you see yourself. They watch you go about life and they'll know if it's the right choice for you. You also have a bond and trust with the people you talk to. They would never lie or let you down. If they knew it wasn't right for you they would stop you before making that choice. It's important to trust those that you go to, they should be honest and trustworthy. Family and friends know your lifestyle and would let you know if that choice wouldn't be right for your life. Getting advice from others that know you well is one way to make the best choice.

Secondly, your peers that you go to have experience. Everyone has had to make a choice. Whether it was small or something very important they can still help. Anyone from siblings to teachers are always open to talk with you. I have an older sister and she helps me out a lot because she's experienced similar situations. For example school, she's been through more grades than me, she really is someone with experience to help me out. Going to others that are older works well for me. Like my parents, they've raised me and have been through more than I have. They've experienced a lot and have been in my shoes. I can always count on them for advice. Friends are also great for advice, you have a bond and can truly relate to their life. Family and friends care for you, they wouldn't let you make the wrong choice. It's also smart to go to others because there experience might've not been well. So it's better to go to them so you don't get yourself into a bad position. Going to family and friends with experience is another way to make the best choice.

Lastly, your peers will help you and guide you to the best choice. Never make a choice right away, it can lead to a bad experience. You never known what your getting into. Especially go to your parents, they need to agree with your decision. Even if you think it's right others may not. It can be hard sometimes because everyone has there own opinion. At first your peers may disagree but that's why it's so important to talk things out. In the end it's about compromise and that can result in the best thing for you. When asking for advice others might have other ideas. Always let them share with you because it could be better for you. Like I mentioned earlier others have experience. So it's very important because they will help you. Family and friends will always guide you to what's right, so trust them. Talking things through always makes me feel better because decisions can be stressful. Letting others talk you through it will guide you to the best choice.

In conclusion, it's very important to go to others for advice. They know you, they are experienced, and will guide you through it. Going to others will truly give you the best outcome and will be less stressful for you. Next time you have to make a decision definitely talk to your peers because they will help you make the best choice.",0,1
"Extracurricular activities are good for everyone. For example you might want to go into acting or sports. You might just want to try something new. You might think that something is boring but then you end up liking it. Just like how I never thought I would like basketball but I tried out for the team. Turns out I do like basketball and I think I'm pretty good at it.

Have you ever wanted to try something new but don't know where to start? Well, join a club. You get to meet new people and you get to try something new. If you think you like something else better you can always join that club. You might even be surprised by how much you like it.

I have sometimes thought that I would never play basketball. My parents always thought softball was my sport. Until I saw my brother playing basketball and thought that it looked fun. So, I played on an AAU basketball team. It was so much fun to play and to meet new friends. So, I quit softball and now I play basketball. But, I still have friends from my softball team.

Now, say you a new student at a new school. Like anyone else you would like to make new friends. So, why don't you join a club? Everyone in that club likes the same interests as you. You would make friends right away. Even if you quit everyone in that club will still be your friend. You can move to a different club and make friends there.

So, yes I do agree that students must participate in an extracurricular activity. They get to try something new. They could try something that they think the don't like but then actually do. They can make new friends. So I think it is a good choice for students to take extracurricular activities.",0,1
"Wouldn't it be great to be able to drive to places without anyone actually driving? I think that would be fantastic! Today, I am going to talk about driverless cars. I think that driverless cars should continue to be developed because, they would make the world a more productive place, the cars are still in development and they would be cheaper in the long run.

First, I will talk about how they would make the world a more productive place. While we are driving we spend so much time paying attention to the road, but what if didn't have to? We would have that time to do other things, like maybe work on a new great project that could change the world. With driverless cars, taxi drivers wouldn't have a job. That means that they would have to find something else to do. They could become doctors and bring us back to health; They could become officers and protect us from the dangers in the world.

Next, I will talk about how they are still in development. I think that a lot of people are judging driverless cars by the way they are working now. We shouldn't give up on them so soon; Scientific discoveries happen all the time. Someone will find something that completely changes driverless cars for the better. Besides, they already show so much promise. In test drives, these cars could survive more than half a million miles without a crash. Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have driverless cars by 2020. Let's wait until then to judge driverless cars.

Lastly, I will talk about how they are cheaper. The driverless cars that Google cofounder Sergey Brin foresees would use half the fuel we use today. Fossil fuels are becoming an issue, but what if we had one less use for them? Without the need for so much fuel that wouldn't be so much of an issue anymore, and we would have more time to plan for whenever the time may be that we run out of fossil fuels. Also, if we perfected the driverless car there will be a lot less crashes. Without so many crashes we wouldn't be paying for repairs as often. We also wouldn't pay for the medical bills and such associated with an automobile accident.

In conclusion, I think that we should keep working on driverless cars. We should keep developing them because, they would increase the world's productivity, they are cheaper in the long run and because they deserve a chance. It would be great to be able to drive somewhere without anyone actually driving.",0,1
" It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Imagine starting a new school year; students are ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to see their friends. It comes time to pick up their schedule and they see that there is some classes that they really would not like to take but those classes are required for them to take. A students starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes are required. I believe students should not be required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only affect them but it would also affect their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class but they would not put in the effort they need in order to recieve the credit.

In many cases, students who do not like the classes they are taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. Having good grades is what makes your GPA great. We all know that having good grades and keeping a good GPA is very important when it comes to college and universities. Students will need to attend a college or a university in order to get a good paying job. By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not fall in their career field. For example, a student might want to work at a fast food restaurant in the future but in high school this students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal of working at a fast food restaurant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist of course.

Secondly, if you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just won't show up that whole school day. Having good attendance is also very important to have because if students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class.",1,0
"Yes, it could be useful! It could be used to do a lot of good things. For example, we could use it to help us determine whether someone is lying or not during an interigation or in a court. However, in order or both of those to be accurate we would need to make some adjustments.

Nevertheless, the technology could be used to show how and when students in school become confused or bored with a subject, just like the author stated. It could also advance our understanding of how emotions work. The Mona Lisa, who we saw in the picture, looks like she has a weird cross between a smile and a frown. It is very fascinating how this all works. This can also tell us if celebrities and politicians are being truthful.

In conclusion, it could be very benifical to study this subject. It could further advance the science of the human face and emotions. Like the author said, who knew faces could reveal so much about our emotions.",0,1

"There has been an increasing concern about whether driverless cars should be developed as the technology of autonomous cars advances rapidly. Google has had cars that can drive themselves under special conditions since 2009 and many people are excited to witness the development of driverless cars. However, there are also some people worrying about the disadvantages of driverless cars. In my opinion, driverless cars have more negative effects than positive effects at present.

First of all, driverless cars are not safe enough and today, these so-called driverless cars can only control themselves under centain conditions, which means human drivers are still necessary. Just as BMW pointed out:"" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This means human drivers still play an important role in driving and they should always be prepared so that they are able to take over immediately if necessary. It deserves consideration that whether what we want is just a driving-assisting system. If driverless car cannot control itself under all conditions safely, it is not worth devoting millions dollers and endless hours into its development.

In addition, there are not systematic laws about the driverless cars now. As the author mentioned in the article, who should be responsible if an accident happens because of technology failures, the driver or the manufacturer? There are many more problems to think about. For example, how could laws be made so that driverless cars must pass certain tests before entering market? Should people make a law to force car owners to do a function test regularly? All these problems deserve public attention and should be taken seriously.

Last but not least, drivers may be challenged mentally since they need to be prepared to take over the car while in most of the time, they do not have to do anything. The author stated that some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. It might be helpful. However, people still cannot enjoy ""driving fun"" and a better solution is needed.

In conclusion, driverless cars have negative impacts on the society, at least at this time. At present, the uncertainty of safety, the lack of relevant laws and the psychological challenges it brings make driverless car impossible to be widely accepted. As an attractive concept, it may be inspiring to people, but it still has a long way to go before it can actullay be taken into practice. ",0,1
"From what I've read, I believe that the Face is a natural landform. There are three reasons that I think this, and I'll explain them all in this essay.

My first reason for believing the Face is a natural landform is that if NASA knew anything about aliens or artifacts, then they would probably tell us. In paragraph 5, the author states, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" It's their job, and they would get paid more if they discovered something about aliens.

My next reason is that even if the first photo taken of the Face looked like an alien artifact, the second photo proved that wrong by having a much higher quality.. According to the author in paragraph 11, ""if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were,"" which proves that the Face isn't an alien structure or artifact.

My last reason is that the Face is a mesa, just like the kind we have on Earth. In paragraph 12, the text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West,"" showing how the Face is just a normal landform with strange shadows.

In conclusion, there are probably many other arguments that prove that the Face is just a natural landform, but the reasons above are the most convincing ones I found in this article.",0,1

"Limiting car usage will have many advantages. Not only will it reduce pollution ,but it will also encourage a more healthy lifestyle. Also limiting car usage may help ween us off of our dependence on foreign oil. Car usage has caused a lot of problems economically, environmentally, and physically for the United States.

To start off, car usage is very bad for our environment. The number one cause of air pollution in the U.S. is transportation. So, if we found a cleaner and more environmentallyfriendly way of transportation that help a lot. One way would be to reduce car usage. It would be much better if once or twice a week people would ride their bike or walk to work or where ever they are going. I understand that some people live to far away from where ever they are going to ride a bike or walk ,but if you carpool with people who are also going to the same place you save on gas money and you will also be helping the environment.

In addition to helping the environment, limiting car usage will also promote a healthier life style. With the united state's obesity rates skyrocketing we could use all the healthy lifestyle promoting we can get. By limiting car usage we can encourage people to walk and bike to where ever they are going. Which will influence people to add a little exercise into their daily routine.

Along with promoting a healthier lifestyle, limiting car usage can also help the U.S. without major problem. Over the years the U.S. has had many great presidents,but almost all of them have promised the same thing, that they will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. But nothing has happened. I believe that limiting car usage will help us in reducing the United states dependence on foreign oil because if we aren't driving our cars as often we won't need as much oil.

In conclusion, the advantages to limiting car usage are that it will reduce pollution, promote a healthier lifestyle, and it will reduce our dependence on foreign oil.",0,1
"In my personal opinion, driverless cars should not be developed due to the serious situations of computer failure, driver alertness, and legal conflicts. Each of these factors can have significant effects, from wrecks to law suits. Completely driverless cars may be a problem if these issues aren't addressed or taken into full consideration.

Computer systems on driverless cars seem to be complex and sophisticated in comparison to modern-day cars. This can be a positive, but it can also pose as a threat. If the computer system breaks down, the driver may not have time to react. How will the driver have the ability to take control in a broke down, completely driverless car? This is especially true if the driver has taken advantage of the relaxation involved with these cars and falls asleep. The driver may not even be aware that the system has failed. Plus, the complicated set up would make it an expensive, difficult system to repair.

Alertness is the most important element of driving, as described in the article. Yet, driverless cars would eliminate some of that awareness through entertainment systems. Yes, the in-car system's ability to shut off in case of an emergency is ingenious, but the driver won't be immediately prepared to take over in some cases. In addition. it's important for the driver to be on the look out for hidden patches of ice and other weather-related conditions that the driverless cars may not sense. Another example includes road construction. These instances require much care and caution, and a driver must know what's going on in order to reverse any mistakes the car wants to perform.

If an accident were to occur, the article mentions legal disputes: ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" Through my eyes, that is a controversial problem to solve. Would the driver be accused of just not paying attention? Would the manufacturer be sued for a programming mistake? It can lean both ways; the driver could've been too distracted (but that's what the entertainment systems are for) or the manufacturers were inept for the task of building such a complex car. This is a debatable topic, and I don't believe it would be worth the time and money to come to a resolution.

In conclusion, driverless cars can still be a danger despite all the sensors. What it boils down to is driver awareness, which cannot always be helped. Instead of making even more drivers unalert with entertainment systems, we should concentrate on teaching drivers to be aware of their surroundings in all situations. Not everything can be solved through a technologically-advanced smart car, but many problems can be avoided if there is a driver operating in full control.",0,1
"Have you ever asked someone for his or her advice on a subject, and ended up not liking their answer? Maybe as a result asked someone else instead? Seeking multiple opinions seems to help people make better choices, but why? What makes a choice feel so much safer, and clearer, when it's made by listening to someone else's opinion?

I think that it's easy to overlook, but this question can have a much deeper meaning than you may have first thought.

I know that when I am feeling indecisive, I like to be able to consider as many outcomes or results as possible. Therefore I ask multiple people for insight on my situation. But sometimes I only make it harder on myself by getting answers that are all over the place! Whether it's in regards to something as simple as what flavor coffee to get that day, or what kind of car I should buy! My friends can never seem to agree, and I can never seem to choose on my own.

For example when the walls in my new house were being painted, I asked a few friends of mine what color I should have done. My absolute best friend Generic_Name said, ""I would love it if you got baby blue!"" But when I asked my brother he responded with, ""Just paint them black, doesn't matter anyway."" I know, not a big help. The last person I asked was my co-worker Generic_Name, he said, ""NO! Don't paint them! Walls should be left alone."" What does that even mean? And even though I didn't get any answers that helped me make a decision, I still feel like I couldn't have done it without them!

I did a project on social anxiety in the fifth grade, I hardly even remember what all I actually did. But I do remember that one experiment I performed while studying social anxiety was asking a friend of mine, Generic_Name, what she thought of a t-shirt I had found online, and asking if she would want it. She was excited and said, ""Oh my goodness really? I love that shirt, thank you!"" and gave me a hug before walking away. Later I asked another girl the same question, making sure that Generic_Name could hear the response, but the second girl said the shirt was ugly and that she'd never wear it. Generic_Name later came to me and said she did not want the shirt, and that she had changed her mind. This was just the reaction I had been looking for, and another reason that I believe explains why we ask so eagerly for others opinions is that the question is not of an opinion, but of acceptance.

Why does seeking multiple opinions help us make better choices? I believe this question has many different answers, based off of different opinions, the fear of being rejected for personal opinions. A constant need of approval. Perhaps just simply wanting to be informed of as many possible outcomes thinkable. Maybe your just a girl with walls that need painted, or maybe your a guy that feels he needs to bend to meets others' standards, either way, we ask for advice left and right, seemingly everyday.                                                                                                                                       ",0,1
"Sports and activities. At this point in our lives, who doesn't really do one? Doing things like these keep our minds, and our body's active. It helps keeps us stay focused on our weight, grades, and the way we act. If our principle wanted to move the grade average to a B to play sports, I think that there would be a lot of chaos. Our schools practically revolve around our work, our sports, and our other activities. We are all on the same team no matter who you root for, it's still what we enjoy doing.

If you had to have the grade average of a B to play in any activities, i don't know what would happen. Maybe it could help people bring their grades up, or maybe it wouldn't. You never know til you try something, so it's always hard just to guess. I would go against the grade average being moved up, because I don't think it would really help. Sports or activities are always your choice, whether you want to play or not. Whether you should shoot, kick, jump, tackle, or just close your eyes. It's your choice, and no one else can change that for you.

I also think that if they moved it up, many people would just stop playing. If you don't understand a school subject, and yet you can still pass I think that it's okay. I mean, yes you would want to be able to understand things a whole lot better, but if they're not going to help you in the future what's the point? Getting good grades is a fantastic thing, but if you really want something it all comes down to you. It's your choice to follow your heart and do what you want to do, or to do what's best for you.

Whether you're for, or against something it's still your choice to do what you want. Making choices can be tough, but you can always try to find something out. That's why I would be against moving the grade average up to a B. I believe that it could be a good thing, or a bad thing but you'll never know til you try. Those are my reasons to be against it, but no matter what it's still passing. In the end, it will always come down to your choice, and what's best for you.",0,1
"Dear Principal,

I know that you probably think that cell phones are disrupting classes. I know that you probably think that school is not the place for cell phones. I know that you have reasons that you should just ban cell phones from this school altogether. I know that you think that kids should just go use the school phone if they really need to contact someone. Kids these days, just don't work like that. Do you remember what it felt like to be a teenager? Contact with other kids is vital to surviving in middle school and high school. So, I don't think that you should ban cell phones from our school. I think that students should be able to have their cell phones out during lunch and free periods, and I do agree that phones should be turned off during all of our classes.

First of all, teenagers text their friends. I know this because, well, I text my friends all the time. I don't really spend my time texting my family because I'm usually always with them when I'm outside of school. When I go to school, I'm with my friends just as much as I'm with my family when I'm at home. So, what's the harm in letting kids have their cell phones at lunch? Most of the people that they text are going to be sitting right next to them anyway. So, I don't think there's going to be much of a difference there. At free periods, though, kids are going to want to stay in contact. Honestly, when there's nothing else to do, I usually just pull out my cell phone and start texting other people. So, during free time, when there's nothing else to do, kids should be able to keep in contact with each other, just to give them something to do, if they have nothing better to do.

Sometimes, it's hard to talk to people face to face, especially in school. Sometimes, you can't find the person you want to talk to, or sometimes, you just don't really want to physically get up and go talk to them. For some reason, this actually seems to happen a lot. Cell phones have kind of created this phenomenon that you don't have to go and talk to people face to face... You can just call them or text them. If a student is trying to find another student, without getting up and actually having to go and find them, they can just take two seconds and type, ""Where are you?"" or they can just call them. It's as simple as that. Letting kids have their phones at certain times in school would save a lot of people a lot of time.

So, in conclusion, kids should be able to have their cell phones out at certain times during the school day like lunch, and free time. It would make kids enjoy school a whole lot more, trust me. Cell phones have kind of become a part of teenagers. I know that my teenager years, and a lot of other kids' teenage years are made up of cell phones and text messaging and all of this new technology. So, if you take away cell phones in our school for good, you kind of take away a part of who we are. I think that you should really think about this before you just ban cell phones from our school completely.

"Many students love sports, but getting good grades is essential to be successful in life.

There are many reasons why the choice to switch the requirement to a B is necessary because kids will have to focus in school and not on sports to be able to play.

The reason that so many kids have C averages is because they do not care about their school work and grades, as long as they get to play video games or sports.

The sports kids are the ones who do not realize how important jobs are to families and survival. If a kid keeps on getting C averages, they may get D averages which will most likely decrease to F averages. In order to go to college, one must have 23 high school credits, 12 in which are from math, language arts, and science.

School is one of the most important aspects of life, and in order to succeed and do sports, these kids will have to put on their thinking caps and mature up, and they will end up thanking us later in life for ensuring they had good grades.

Good grades can almost ensure people a meritorious career, and they will have good lives for their families and have good shelter.

The kids with C averages don't strive very hard because their lives revolve around sports.

The kids all have lives outside of school, and think that school is a waste of time in the way of their video games and sports.

They will end up failing in life if they do not succeed in their education, and that means they will most likely have health problems and an premature death.

So, you are making an excellent decision by switching the requirement from C average to B average because it will help students have better futures.

They also will feel proud of themselves for using the time wisely, since there is no second chance.",0,1
" One way to improve student achievement is to create a study group. I think creating a study group is an excellent idea for students as it can help them improve their grades, have more free time, less tired from school, and grateful to turn to that and get help from teachers and students at the same time.

First, of all, establishing a study group is creative because it helps students improve their grades. Students get more work done when teachers and other students are helping them. They also, get to study more and don't have to worry about failing the test. Let's say a student is having difficulties on a question on their homework. A student can stay after school and get help with the questions they have trouble with or needs help with.

Also, students have more free time after school. Students have the ability to spend time with their family and friends, and go places. A study group sounds like a group I would join because after I come home, I'd relax or go out or hangout with some friends. If I joined a group like that, I'd be happy because I wouldn't be the only one who struggles on work and we could help each other out on work we don't understand.

Furthermore, A study group helps students less tired. They don't need to worry their grades being bad because they had help from teachers and students. They get to sleep more and wake up the very next day and get ready for school. Students should have it easy because theses days students go through so much in life. Just imagine what their going through right now.

Next, Study groups and help students on many different things but at least they learn something new. Everyday Students these day try and try the best they can but they lose hope because they feel like they can't do anything. I believe every student has the courage to get something they done just like that.

Finally, I think creating a study group is great for the students because it helps students improve their grades, give them more free time when they get home, less tired from school, and grateful that they have this group.

"Do students benefit from attending classes at home? There are schools that offer distance learning as an option for students to take classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people say that it is better to attend classes at home, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students do not benefit from attending classes at home.

Attending classes at school positively impacts others. Going to school helps students meet new people that they otherwise would never meet. For example, they would meet counselors that help with their future, coaches who keep them on track with grades, teachers who want the best for them, and many more people who will influence their character.

Also, students can form connections with their teachers. If their teacher understands them personally, they can come up with better ways to help them learn. Furthermore, attending school provides a better opportunity for developing people skills. At home, the individual is not interacting with anyone; However, they are forced to interact with people at school.

In addition to affecting others, going to school impacts the individual. The student is given the opportunity to go somewhere instead of being stuck in the house in front of a computer. Moreover, going to school offers things that being at home does not. At school, students can join sports and clubs such as basketball or drama club. They learn how to work as a team as well as learning more about themselves and what interests them. Also, they gain experience. Students that attend classes at school get to experience different situations, environments, and relationships. Every classroom is a different learning environment and every friendship is unique. Schooling at home does not give them that experience.

Although some may disagree, students benefit from attending classes at school. They meet new people, form connections, develop people skills, and gain new experiences. There are people who believe that students benefit from taking online classes at home, but this is not true. In conclusion, students do not benefit from attending classes at home.",0,1

Dear Principal,

It has come to my attention that some students have been performing community service, but others think it takes too much time away from what they need and want to do. Also, you are trying to decide whether to require students to perform community service for a grade. So, I am writing you this letter to express my position on whether students should be required to do community service or not. I strongly support students to be required to do community service because it will teach them responsibility, help them learn what it is like to work for a living, and the students who participate will become more mature.

First, I strongly support students to be required to do community service because it will teach them responsibility. In a nation wide poll, 60% of parents think their child is not responsible with their time and money. With community service requirements, this rate could go down with more students completing community service. I think this would make many parents very happy, because they have more responsible children.

Secondly, community service would help teens learn what it is like to work for a living. In many cases, students don't know what it is like to work because their parents are always buying everything they need to survive and grow up. They might take advantage of their parents because of getting everything they want. So, community service would help them understand their parents perspective a little bit more.

Last but not least, the students who participate in the community service will become more mature. When they show up to volunteer, they would see how seriously most jobs are taken, and learn that it will be them working hard when they get out of college, or even during college. So, they should mature a lot during community service.

In conclusion, I strongly support students to be required to do community service because the students who participate in the community will become more mature, the work would help teens learn what it is like to work for a living, and it will teach them responsibility. So by now, I hope you have made up your mind on whether students should be required to complete community service or not. Just think of the number of students coming to your office in trouble will decrease. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my letter.

" People should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others.

Everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. For example, if someone bought someone else something that they didn't like or didn't want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldn't have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they?

Also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. For example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. People will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. Another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but won't read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. This is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what you're ordering comes with.

Lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. For example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. Another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because they're hurting badly and doctors will say you're perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. Last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you don't need but will still give it to you because they can. Some therapist don't believe in that but most do.

So therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes don't know what they're doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments. So it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others.",1,0
" Elective classes are an essential component of a well-rounded education. While some students may prefer to have a elective class because they are learning what they like, and will be less difficult for them to understand the class, others may not be as enthusiastic about the idea. In my opinion, students should be required to take elective classes because they attend to school every day, students are taught in what they want to learn and students are much more successful in class.

Many students do not attend to school in order to not have a class that they do not like. Students that use to not attend school is when they have a class that is not interesting to learn; they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future, and letting students to take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class. Furthermore, if students have an elective class they will have that exicitement to start the class on time and not be late, neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning.

Students should be guided in what they may think is useful and much helpful for them. In some schools, people have heard that many students are taught in things that may not be needed in life like art, some students take art because they like that class and probably because in the future they might be planning to become an art teacher, but for others, it is preferable to select an elective class that will manage their interests and help them be successful. As a result of taking an elective class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keeping learning.

However, others may argue that students should be required to take a music, art, or drama class because students can have entertainment having these kinds of classes, but I still believe that students should be required to take an elective class because learning what they like, they put much effort to get knowledge and good grades, for example, studying, paying attention to what the teacher is saying, participating in class, or any other activity. Moreover, obtaining good results of what they decide to choose to become a successful student.

Students who take elective classes have the advantage of learning what is interesting for them, and being successful not just in class but also might be helpful for students in a future. Being able to choose a",1,0
